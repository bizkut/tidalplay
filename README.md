# tidalplay
Tidal player for command line derived from [tidalbar](https://github.com/bsilvereagle/tidalbar)

## Scope
The main idea of this project is to stream music from Tidal with target loudness (defined in EBU R 128) and the highest possible quality for the given equipment. To achieve this goal a player needs to know the following parameters of the playback equipment:
- output voltage at 0 db
- output impedance
- headphones/speakers impedance
- headphones/speakers sensitivity
- maximum sample rate of DAC
- maximum bit depth of DAC
- ALSA name of the hardware volume control of the DAC

```
## Defaults
- 75 db target loudness to avoid hearing damage. Please note that some headphones does not give "flat" frequency response at such SPL. For instance, AKG K702 are optimized for 80-85 db. So some SPL-dependent equalization is desirable and will be implemented later.
- To avoid [ringing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringing_artifacts) in poorly mastered music, the (sox) upsampling uses slow rolloff slighly apodizing low-pass filter with 85% bandwidth, based on [archimago](https://archimago.blogspot.com/2018/01/musings-more-fun-with-digital-filters.html) measurements. 
- 4 db PCM headroom to avoid DAC overloading due to the internal resampling, dithering, filtering, etc, see [BenchmarkÂ®](https://benchmarkmedia.com/blogs/application_notes/intersample-overs-in-cd-recordings) and [archimago](https://archimago.blogspot.com/2018/09/musings-measurements-look-at-dacs.html) articles for clarification.

## Usage
1. Adjust MySink, MySource, CARD and target_SPL variables in `tidalplay.py` to match your playback setup and target loundess, respectively.
4. Open terminal.
5. cd to the tidalplay folder.
6. Type, e.g.,  
`./tidalplay.py playlist/4d056fb5-99f9-46ec-8ff3-f2dddd41821f` or  
`./tidalplay.py artist/7144334` or  
`./tidalplay.py album/33376720` or  
`./tidalplay.py track/60815627` or
